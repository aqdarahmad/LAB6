SystemVerilog Calculator Class
Overview

This project demonstrates a SystemVerilog class implementing a basic Calculator with:

Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

Static methods: for operations that don’t require an object instance.

The class illustrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in SystemVerilog, including constructors, functions, and static methods.

Features

Constructor

Prints a message when a Calculator object is created.

Example:

Calculator calc = new();


Arithmetic Functions

add(a, b) – returns a + b.

sub(a, b) – returns a - b.

multi(a, b) – returns a * b.
